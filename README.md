# Book Recommendation System

This project is a simple book recommendation system implemented using the collaborative filtering algorithm with TensorFlow.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data is cleaned and transformed into a suitable format for the recommendation model. The dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset).

2. **Model Building**: The collaborative filtering algorithm is implemented using TensorFlow to build the recommendation model.

3. **Model Training**: The model is trained using the preprocessed data.

4. **Recommendation Generation**: The trained model is used to generate book recommendations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git`
